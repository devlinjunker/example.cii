## Intro
<!-- Quick Description, could match Github repo description or have a little more info-->

This is an example project with a goal of 100% passing [Core Infrastructure Initiative Criteria] status. It is based off of the [GitHub Semver Project] Template. 

Contains the following improvements for passing status:
- Automated Test Suite (for Bash Scripts)
- Static Code Analysis (Linting)

Also contains:
- [PR Landmine Action]


## Dependencies/Frameworks
<!-- List the frameworks, libraries, and tools the project uses: -->

- [Bulldozer] - Github Application to Auto Squash and Merge feature PRs
- [Git-mkver] - Binary that helps with determining next semantic version based on Git Tags
- [BATS] - Automated Test Suite for Bash Scripts
- [ShellCheck] - Linting Tool for Bash Scripts
- [PR Landmine Action] - Mutation Testing Pull Requests

## Quick Setup/Run
<!-- This section should try to quickly explain how to setup the project and start using it (server/app/demo/template) - ideally in list format -->

 - [ ] Review [Wiki]
    - [FAQ]
    - [README Pages]
 - [ ] Review documentation in [GitHub Semver Project]
 - [ ] Clone repo (with submodules)
    - If forking to a new project, follow the [Steps for New Project] before adding new code

### Add Code
 - [ ] Create branch matching style `<prefix>/<hyphenated-description>`
 - [ ] Add changes to branch
 - [ ] Before push, if hooks are installed, should do the following (otherwise manual):
    - [ ] Run bash linting with `./scripts/bin/lint.sh`
    - [ ] Run all unit tests with `./scripts/bin/test.sh`
 - [ ] Create Pull Request against `develop`


### Create Release
See full details in the Github Semver Project [wiki](https://github.com/devlinjunker/template.github.semver/wiki/Release)
 - **Must be after `feature/*` or `feat/*` branch is merged**
 - [ ] Initiate `release-cut` GitHub Action
 - [ ] Merge the created `release-*` PR to `main` to start release
    - **Avoid `squash and merge`**
